    <h1>David Hughes</h1>
    <p class="intro">I’ve been working in digital product design delivering results for 15 years. </p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <h3>2005-2009</h3>

    <p>I graduated with 1st class honours in Interactive Multimedia Design (2009) from the University of Ulster. It was an interesting blend of design and technology—with a sandwich year working in indiustry. </p>

    <h2>AV Browne</h2>
    <h3>Designer • 2007-2009</h3>
    <p>After my placement year working as an intern, I spent another year here full time designing websites and  digital marketing material (emails, banners etc) for clients such as Ulsterbank, Aer Lingus, Boylesports and Jameson Whiskey.</p>

    <h2>Front</h2>
    <h3>Designer • 2009-2012</h3>
    <p>Working as a Designer at respected design, strategy and technology studio, Front—I was fortunate enough to contribute to the design and UX of successful projects for a number of clients including the Abbey Theatre, Leckey and Carte Blanche Greetings. </p>

    <h2>Typecast</h2>
    <h3>Product Designer • 2010-2012</h3>
    <p>During my time at Front I was also a key member of the design team behind Typecast; a browser based design tool that helped designers make better typographic decisions. In addition to being part of the team that built the Typecast product itself, I also learned how important community was to launching a product.</p> 
    
    <p>Typecast was used by over one million people and was acquired by Monotype in late 2012. My day to day role at Typecast was usually a blend of wireframing, interaction design, visual design, design research and usability testing. </p>

    <h2>Monotype</h2>
    <h3>Product Designer -> Product Manager • 2012-2017</h3>
    <p>After joining Monotype as a designer in 2012, I worked on various projects that helped Monotype experiment with new paradigms and business models. In 2013, I led the UX and Design of a brand new product category; a cloud based font subscription service for large agencies and publishers which gave them freedom and flexibility to try an unlimited number of typefaces from the Monotype Library for a fixed annual fee. This product evolved into the Monotype Library Subscription. </p>

    <p>I spent the last 18 months of my time at Monotype working as a Product Manager in charge of Monotype's Enterprise products ($40m+ business unit). I spent most of my time talking to customers and working with a cross functional team to invent ways to simplify Monotype's offering for this segment of the market. </p>
    <p>Before leaving Monotype in April 2017, I was responsible for the launch of a new license type. Aimed at Global 2000 brands, this product was designed to reduce complexity and headaches that come with using fonts in a global brand identity — whilst enabling brands to achieve the consistency they need across every device or touchpoint they create.</p>

    <h2>Rotor</h2>
    <h3>Product Design Lead -> Head of Product • 2018-Current</h3>
    <p>At Rotor, we create video creation tools for the music industry. We believe video creation should be easy, fast and affordable.  </p>
    
    <p>After joining as lead product designer — we started to get a bit of traction. I led initiatives to start measuring customer satisfaction and quickly identified numerous high impact improvements.</p>
   
    <p>Shortly thereafter I was promoted to Head of Product. From there, I was responsible for defining what we worked on, when and why. 
      
    <p>I built a small design team from scratch as we expanded our product offering, including some first in category products. Our revenue started to grow. </p>

    <p>I helped transform and diversify our business model (more than once) setting the business up to capture new, higher value segments of the market—offering services beyond video creation. </p>
